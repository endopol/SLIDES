There is a ``shadow region'' where the disposition of space is not known.

The weight profile can be divided into three phases: The first phase, when nodes are likely to share cells with angular neighbors, shows a increase in weight as radius increases and radial neighbors get further and further away. The second phase, when angular neighbors are too far away to share cells, has constant weight. The third phase, as we reach the edge of the sampling pattern, shows a rapid doubling of weight, as nodes with many inner and outer (smaller or greater radius) neighbors give way to nodes with few or no outer neighbors. }}{7}}
